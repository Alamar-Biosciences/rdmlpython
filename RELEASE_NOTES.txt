----------------------------

- RDML files require the xml data in the file rdml_data.xml.
  As some machines do not follow this requirement, the 
  function load_any_zip(self, filename) opens the first 
  file contained in the compressed archive.

- Upon import of amplification or melting curve data wells 
  without the columns Well, Sample, Sample Type, Target, 
  Target Type and Dye are skipped with a message. This is 
  intended to be used for empty wells.
